The administration of :term:`replica sets <replica set>` includes the
initial deployment of the set, adding and removing members to a set,
and configuring the operational parameters and properties of the
set. Administrators generally need not intervene in failover or
replication processes as MongoDB automates these functions. In the
exceptional situations that require manual interventions, the
tutorials in these sections describe processes such as resyncing a
member. The tutorials in this section form the basis for all replica
set administration.

   :doc:`/administration/replica-set-deployment`
      Instructions for deploying replica sets, as well as adding and
      removing members from an existing replica set.

      :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`
         Configure a three-member replica set for production systems.

      :doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set`
         Convert an existing standalone ``mongod`` instance into a
         three-member replica set.

      :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`
         Add a new member to an existing replica set.

      :doc:`/tutorial/remove-replica-set-member`
         Remove a member from a replica set.

      Continue reading from :doc:`/administration/replica-set-deployment` for
      additional tutorials of related to setting up replica set deployments.

   :doc:`/administration/replica-set-member-configuration`
      Tutorials that describe the process for configuring replica set
      members.

      :doc:`/tutorial/adjust-replica-set-member-priority`
         Change the precedence given to a replica set members in an
         election for primary.

      :doc:`/tutorial/configure-secondary-only-replica-set-member`
         Make a secondary member ineligible for election as primary.

      :doc:`/tutorial/configure-a-hidden-replica-set-member`
         Configure a secondary member to be invisible to applications in
         order to support significantly different usage, such as a
         dedicated backups.

      Continue reading from
      :doc:`/administration/replica-set-member-configuration` for more
      tutorials that describe replica set configuration.

   :doc:`/administration/replica-set-maintenance`
      Procedures and tasks for common operations on active replica set
      deployments.

      :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`
         Increase the size of the :term:`oplog` which logs operations.
         In most cases, the default oplog size is sufficient.

      :doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`
         Sync the data on a member. Either perform initial sync on a new
         member or resync the data on an existing member that has fallen
         too far behind to catch up by way of normal replication.

      :doc:`/tutorial/force-member-to-be-primary`
         Force a replica set member to become primary.

      :doc:`/tutorial/change-hostnames-in-a-replica-set`
         Update the replica set configuration to reflect changes in
         members' hostnames.

      Continue reading from :doc:`/administration/replica-set-maintenance` for
      descriptions of additional replica set maintenance procedures.

   :doc:`/tutorial/troubleshoot-replica-sets`
      Describes common issues and operational challenges for replica
      sets. For additional diagnostic information, see
      :doc:`/faq/diagnostics`.
