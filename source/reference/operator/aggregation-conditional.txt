   * - Name

     - Description

   * - :expression:`$cond`

     - A ternary operator that evaluates one expression, and depending on
       the result, returns the value of one of the other two expressions.
       Accepts either three expressions in an ordered list or three named
       parameters.
   

   * - :expression:`$ifNull`

     - Returns either the non-null result of the first expression or the
       result of the second expression if the first expression results in a
       null result. Null result encompasses instances of undefined values or
       missing fields. Accepts two expressions as arguments. The result of
       the second expression can be null.
   

   * - :expression:`$switch`

     - Evaluates a series of case expressions. When it finds an expression
       which evaluates to ``true``, ``$switch`` executes a specified
       expression and breaks out of the control flow.
